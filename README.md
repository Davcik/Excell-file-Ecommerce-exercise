Repository for the creation of the Excel file with the e-commerce exercise 

I have created an Excel file as the e-commerce exercise for the higher education courses shop that includes interconnected sheets for financial analysis. The file contains three main worksheets with structured data and relationships between key business assumptions.

File Structure

Sheet 1: Assumptions
This foundation sheet contains all key parameters that drive the business model:
- Monthly course volume: 100 courses
- Average pricing: £1,200 per course
- Cost structure: £600 per course (50% variable cost ratio)
- Fixed monthly costs: £5,000
- Product mix breakdown: 40% STEM, 35% Business, 25% Arts courses

Sheet 2: Product Mix & Pricing
This analysis sheet breaks down the course portfolio by category:
- STEM courses: 40 units at £1,500 each = £60,000 revenue
- Business courses: 35 units at £1,200 each = £42,000 revenue
- Arts courses: 25 units at £900 each = £22,500 revenue
- Total monthly revenue: £124,500

Sheet 3: Cash Flow
This operational sheet presents the financial performance over three months:
- Monthly revenue: £120,000 (based on 100 courses × £1,200 average price)
- Variable costs: £60,000 per month
- Fixed costs: £5,000 per month
- Monthly profit: £55,000

Key Features

The spreadsheet provides an integrated framework where:
- Assumptions drive calculations across all sheets
- Product mix percentages automatically calculate course volumes
- Pricing tiers reflect different course categories' market positioning
- Cash flow projections show consistent profitability
  
This model allows for exploring various scenarios by adjusting key assumptions such as course volumes, pricing strategies, or cost structures. 
The structure provides flexibility for further analysis, including sensitivity testing of different pricing models or product mix adjustments to optimise revenue performance in the market.
